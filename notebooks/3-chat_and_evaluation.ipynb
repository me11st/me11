Access to these models is typically provided through APIs or licensed software, often involving subscription fees or pay-per-use pricing models. These models come with professional support, regular updates, and maintenance provided by the developers.

However, LLMs stand out due to their significant size, characterized by two main factors:\\nLarge Training Datasets: LLMs are trained using vast amounts of data, allowing them to learn a wide range of language patterns and nuances.\\nHuge Number of Learnable Parameters: LLMs have a massive number of learnable parameters.

Additionally, it’s important to consider whether it is ethical to use LLMs for tasks traditionally performed by humans, particularly white-collar workers.\\nGeneration of Inappropriate Content: LLMs, often trained on extensive corpora of internet texts, can generate toxic, biased, and otherwise inappropriate or harmful content.
